print("You wake up on a small platform of complex tiles with guard rails made of marble on all sides except north. The world is a yellow-ish red color and the sun is blaring on you. In the distance there is a forrest full of fall leaves and to the north-west you see a large catherdral of red stone. You are wearing blackened leather armour, but you can tell it won't last long.")
