#first description
print("You wake up on a small platform of complex tiles with guard rails made of marble on all sides except north. The world is a yellow-ish red color and the sun is blaring on you. In the distance there is a forrest full of fall leaves and to the north-west you see a large catherdral of red stone. You are wearing blackened leather armour, but you can tell it won't last long.")
#second room description
print("You head towards the north and see a staircase going downwards and to the left hanging along the side of a building made of the same red stone. When you reach the bottom of the staircase you see a giant Knight dressed in black iron armour. The walkway ends where the Knight is standing and there is a door to the south that leads into a room.")
#first room inside a building
print("The building is tall and has arches for doorways. Inside the room you see another pair of the giant Knights across the room from each other. There is a chest that the two are gaurding. To the West you see an exit to the building")
#second open platform
print("You exit the building and step out to another open platform, this one much larger than the last. To the south there is a doorway leading into a building. To the north there is a round building that appears to lead downwards.")
